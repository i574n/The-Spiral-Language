WIP

* Renamed array's iter2i to iteri2 so it matches the F# naming scheme.
* Since tail recursive loops keep stack overflowing in Cython, the array module now uses the imperative while loops instead.
* Added `CythonToNamedTuple` op, the `record` constraint and fixed the lack of dyning bug in `CythonToRecord`'s partial evaluation case.
* Added the `namedtuple` function to core.
* `except *` now does not get generated on main functions returning objects.
* Changed the semantics of the Cython codegen so closure arguments now behave like those for regular join points. This should make interop easier.

2.0.85 (5/22/2021)

Minor fixes. I'll start keeping a changelog from here as development on the compiler has stabilized. For the previous versions, the commit history can serve as the changelog. I have a bunch of stuff on the TODO list, but don't have much drive to work on them at this time. At this point the compiler itself is good enough.

* Added mapi and mapi2 to the `am` module of the `core2` package.
* Fixed filter so it passes the actual element instead of the index.
