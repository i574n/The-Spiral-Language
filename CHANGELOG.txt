2.0.85 (5/22/2021)

Minor fixes. I'll start keeping a changelog from here as development on the compiler has stabilized. For the previous versions, the commit history can serve as the changelog. I have a bunch of stuff on the TODO list, but don't have much drive to work on them at this time. At this point the compiler itself is good enough.

* Added mapi and mapi2 to the `am` module of the `core2` package.
* Fixed filter so it passes the actual element instead of the index.
