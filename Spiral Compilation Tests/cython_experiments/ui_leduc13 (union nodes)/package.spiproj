// Prototype for an alternative implementation that could be used on the GPU.
// It is currently lacking a parallel training function in the `new/train` module. 
// I meant to implement it, but realized it would be a bad fit for the tabular players.
// But either way, it won't be hard to do.

// At this point (5/8/2021) I have it up to my neck with the tabular players. I am sick of them.
// Instead I am going to go straight to the next stage. The linear and then the neural based
// CFR agents.
