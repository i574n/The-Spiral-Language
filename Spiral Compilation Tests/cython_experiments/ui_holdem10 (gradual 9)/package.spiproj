// ui_holdem9 is giving me trouble, so let me gradually transform 8 into that form.
// The goal is to get the value function to converge to zero on Leduc. Something is wrong with 9 and I have absolutely no idea what.
// Even on Flop vs callbot it lost the ability to improve. One my changes broke the system, but I have no idea what because going
// from 8 to 9 I made so many changes.

// I believe in the algorithm itself, but the implementation will need debugging. RL is tough, so it is best to do things step by
// step. Right now 9 has all the pieces, but it is sketch at best. I'll copy them into this as I go along.
