// So much for giving up on deep RL. I guess I will be using it after all. With upside down RL being a flop, the only two challenges
// left are transformers and their unsupervised learning. I'll tackle transformer architectures for the first time in this project.

// Maybe, just maybe the transformers on their own will be enough to crack Holdem, but if that fails, I'll use a curriculum of 
// training the agents on River poker so they can learn to read hands and then setting them loose on the full game. That will
// definitely work, though it is not as elegant as doing it all end to end.
