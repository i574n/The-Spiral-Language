// I made a lot of changes in ui_holdem1 in order to adapt the algorithm for Holdem, but even the simplest agents aren't 
// getting trained properly which makes me suspect that I might have introduced errors.

// What I will do here is take the code from ui_holdem1 and see if it still works on the ui_leduc18 game.
