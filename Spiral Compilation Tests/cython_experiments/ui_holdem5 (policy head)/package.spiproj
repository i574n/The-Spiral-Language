// Here I am going to finally refine the method to the point where it works on Holdem.
// I have a clue that CFR reweighting is making the variance too high, so I am going to play with removing it from the body.
// I will also have to make the changes to the policy net as well in order to have it be updated in the same tabular manner
// as the value net.

// Once I make these changes, hopefully the net should be roboust enough handle Holdem.
