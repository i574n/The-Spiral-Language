// Thing keep going from bad to worse. I did not expect that SARSA would not work. Nor that my
// original update would work better on Flop vs callbot. Because of that I do not see a point in
// trying to run it on Leduc.

// I'll try training the value function end to end with gradients here and see if it makes a 
// difference. But this is the approach I specifically made the semi tabular updates to avoid.
// It would require reward scaling, be sensitive to reward variance and other such nastiness.

// Still, I have to be disciplined and make this test.
