// I'll finish it with this. I have no more ideas for how to improve the NN architecture itself. It certainly won't be easy to
// exceed what I have here. And yet, 10/20(1000) games where the task is just to learn the River vs the callbot is bringing the 
// net to its knees. Despite an entire day of learning, it cannot deal with what is essentailly a bandit problem with all hindsight 
// information given up front.

// I've had the insight that maybe I really should not be forcing the net to learn hand reading up front. Passing in the hand score
// as a feature would make the task a lot easier for the net. Since it is struggling so much, why don't I do it? It should reduce
// the task complexity to just about where it is tractable on the GPU.
