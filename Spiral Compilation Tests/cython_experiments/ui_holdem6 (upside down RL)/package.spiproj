// The fight resumes. I am giving up on deep RL, but not on making the agents. Mapping rewards to actions is a very recent
// invention, and I need to research it. I won't use it directly like in the `Training Agents using Upside-Down Reinforcement 
// Learning` paper, but I will instead make it a source of self supervised learning.

// There are too many things that need doing, so before I move onto the main thing, I need to do some ablation studies.
// First, how does replacing the importance sampling version of the value update compare with reward substitution.
