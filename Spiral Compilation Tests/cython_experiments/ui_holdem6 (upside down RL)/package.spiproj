// The fight resumes. I am giving up on deep RL, but not on making the agents. Mapping rewards to actions is a very recent
// invention, and I need to research it. I won't use it directly like in the `Training Agents using Upside-Down Reinforcement 
// Learning` paper, but I will instead make it a source of self supervised learning.

// There are too many things that need doing, so before I move onto the main thing, I need to do some ablation studies.
// First, how does replacing the importance sampling version of the value update compare with reward substitution.

// Update: It seems along the way I lost the ability to train on Flop. Whatever changes I introduced, some of them must have
// fundamentally broken everything. Not only do I have to track this problem down, but I also need to consider that this might
// be the reason why Holdem is not training.
