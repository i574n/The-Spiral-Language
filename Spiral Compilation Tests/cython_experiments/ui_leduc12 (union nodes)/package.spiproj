// Having finished with the tabular players, here I prepare the game for consumption by NNs.
// In particular, GPUs work much more efficiently when inputs are batched, so I need to be able
// to run multiple games in parallel. The best way to get that is to compile the game to discrete
// steps rather than have them depth traversed as before. Having them in discrete steps will allow
// breath traversal.
