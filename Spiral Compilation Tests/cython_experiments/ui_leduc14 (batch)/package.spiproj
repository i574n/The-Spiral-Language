// CFR training for a DL agent has been implemented and it is very unstable.
// I got a few runs where it does well, but largely it collapses.
// It works well against the static uniform player though.
// My next two ideas are as follows:
// 1) Dropout with key sharing.
// 2) The duality gap training from the 'Generative Minization Networks' paper.
// Before I move to the second option, I want to see if ensemble averaging will have any positive effect.
// The training is unstable due to the minimax nature of the problem, so dropout might not be enough,
// but I should get it out of the way first.
