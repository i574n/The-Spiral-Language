// I need to make some improvement to the ui like adding fractional pot betting buttons.
// I also need to change the game. Turbo SNGs have 10/20 blinds and 1000 starting stacks.
// This means there are 10x times as many possible raises than I expected.
// The blinds can increase and that is not the same thing as the stacks decreasing.

// What I am going to do is make a restricted game of holdem that allows only a certain set
// of possible actions. Training with 1k possible actions right off the bat would just be too hard.
// If I want to get something good, I need to set up a curriculum.

// Once this I'll be able to make my third and hopefully success attempt at training a Holdem agent.
