# LSP

In here I will do a partial rewrite of [vscode-languageserver-node](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node) in F# so I can get a grasp for its functioning. This will serve as a buildup towards establishing Spiral's own language server. Right now the biggest problem is that all the plugin examples are so monstrously complex that I cannot find my way around.

The best choice might be simply to rebuild everything from the bottom-up using that project as a template.
